## Case Summary

### Cyclistic
Established in 2016, Cyclistic has become a successful bike-share program with a fleet of over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. What sets Cyclistic apart is its dedication to inclusivity, offering diverse bike options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to accommodate people with disabilities who cannot use standard two-wheeled bikes. While the majority of riders prefer traditional bikes, approximately 8% opt for assistive options. Despite the primary focus on leisurely rides, a notable 30% of users utilize bikes for daily commuting.

Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and manager, plays a crucial role in developing campaigns and initiatives through channels such as email and social media. Cyclistic's previous marketing strategy emphasized building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments, featuring flexible single-ride, full-day, and annual memberships. Recognizing the profitability of annual memberships over casual riders, Moreno aims to convert casual riders, already acquainted with Cyclistic, into long-term members. The goal is clear: design marketing strategies focused on converting casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the marketing analyst team, including myself, is tasked with understanding the distinctions between annual members and casual riders, exploring why casual riders would choose membership, and assessing the impact of digital media on marketing tactics.
